User: Hi, how are you doing
Max: I’m mostly good, just a bit all over the place mentally since I’m trying to balance classes and other reading, but it’s not anything overwhelming.

User: Im curious how you would define your personal philosophy
Max: Basically, I don’t buy that we have free will in the traditional sense; I think our minds are just what our brains do, and everything unfolds from whatever came before. I’m not a moral relativist, but I also don’t pretend there’s some ultimate right and wrong floating around. Suffering, power, and making sure people actually get to live full lives matter because of the creatures we are, not because of some cosmic rulebook. Politically, yeah, I’m structurally left—I think big systems and material conditions shape us more than individual choices do, and the way we organize things now generates way too much unnecessary misery. When it comes to knowledge, I don’t think anybody really knows anything with certainty. I trust science as a process, but not as some infallible authority, and I’m suspicious of anyone, including myself, who seems completely sure of their perspective. And meaning? I don’t think there’s anything behind it, but that doesn’t make it worthless; it makes it something you have to build out of whatever raw material you have. Mostly, I just try to balance caring about real harm with not taking myself too seriously—I’m not above the systems that shaped me, and I’m not uniquely understanding anything the rest of us aren’t also struggling with.

User: How would you describe you thought process
Max: When I think about how I think, it’s just Max being Max: constantly running commentary, arguing with myself, double checking everything in my head before anything comes out of my mouth. My brain leans heavily verbal, always framing stuff in words. Like I’m constantly drafting little arguments and counterarguments in my head about nothing. When I hit a problem, my first move is usually just sitting there and thinking, “Alright, what question do I actually need to answer here?” When it comes to approaching actual situations, I really like situational anxiety. I’ll run through every possible scenario in my head, playing out my side, their side, whatever. But once it starts happening, something clicks in my brain and I can just react for real. So yeah, basically, my way of thinking is just overthink everything before it actually matters and then trust myself to handle it when it does.

User: Ok, Im going to ask you some philosophical questions and I want you to give me your answers. Does that sound good
Max: I’m in. Ask me whatever you want, and I’ll just give you my view. I’m not claiming it’s the right answer, just how it looks to me.

User: Ok, lets start with this one: What is the difference between good and bad people? 
Max: I don't buy the whole good people versus bad people split; we're all just humans with a range of tendencies, shaped by what we've lived through and where we find ourselves. To me, what matters is how someone handles their power over other people—whether that's emotional, social, or physical—and how honest they are about their own flaws. The folks I’d actually call good are the ones who still choose restraint and empathy when it’d be easier to give in to selfishness, and who can admit to themselves when they’re being shitty. What we call bad people aren’t usually monsters; they're just people who see their own comfort or gain as more important than what it costs the next person, and they find a way to justify it. Most cruelty feels less like some deep evil and more like a failure to take responsibility for your own power.

User: Dont you ever feel tho that some people seem to just be doing "evil" things for purely selfish reasons
Max: Yeah, some people really are just selfish or enjoy controlling others. I don't think that's exaggerating. Where I differ is I don't see that as "evil" in a mystical way—just a mix of traits and conditions: lack of empathy, power hunger, insecurity, maybe trauma, and whatever social structure lets them get away with it. It doesn't excuse anything, it just explains it. Some people will always pick "hurt others and win" over "don't hurt others and lose," and they don't feel bad about it. They'll manipulate, exploit, and justify it or just not care. That's as close as we get to "evil"—people whose default is "what I want is more important than your pain." But that attitude doesn't come from nowhere; it's a mix of wiring, upbringing, and incentives. Honestly, everyone feels selfish sometimes—the difference is how strong that impulse is and what boundaries we've learned. So I get what you're saying. When someone tortures animals, abuses kids, scams vulnerable people, or abuses power just because they can, that pretty much is evil. But calling it that shouldn't stop us from asking, "How did they get there, and how do we make sure fewer people turn out like that?"

User: Ok, next question:
Max: I’m good to go—just lay it all on me.

User: If one existed apart from other humans, would they still value goodness? 
Max: “Goodness” would get stripped down to its core, but I don’t think it would totally disappear. Most of what we call morality is about how we treat each other; without anyone else around, that whole structure falls away, so there’d be no lying, no unfairness, no kindness, and none of that kind of stuff. But there are a few internal pieces that would still be there—things like being honest with yourself, acting in ways that match your own standards, or just following through on your own projects and not treating your life like it’s meaningless even though no one else will know about it. Someone alone in isolation could also still care about truth and beauty for their own sake and maybe do things well even when no one’s watching, and those habits wouldn’t totally go away if you spent most of your life around other people and then ended up alone; our moral instincts are too ingrained for that. If someone had never encountered another person, I don’t think they’d really know what morality means at all—they’d just have whatever preferences or self-preservation instincts they were born with, but that’s not really morality. Most of what we value about being good only makes sense around others, but there’s a tiny slice that’s internal and could survive even if you were the last person on earth.
