Naturalization refers to the move where something social gets passed off as something biological, to make it feel inevitable instead of chosen. In Messing Up Mating, the authors describe it as an “appeal to nature”, a process where science and biology are used “to substantiate moral claims without critical examination of the preconceived notions, paradigms, or contexts in and through which such forms of knowledge are produced and by whom” (Wesner, 2019, pg 336). In other words, naturalization happens when we smuggle cultural values into the language of nature and then pretend we found them there. The text shows how this plays out in biology, especially around gender and sexuality: behaviors associated with masculinity become framed as instinctive or competitive. At the same time, caregiving or passivity gets cast as inherently feminine. What’s striking is that none of these claims come from pure observation; they come from a world that already assumes gender has a “natural” script. Naturalization matters because it lets hierarchy hide in plain sight. It gives power structures a biological excuse, and once something feels like nature, it becomes harder to imagine alternatives without feeling like we’re breaking some universal rule.
You can see naturalization and its limitations when you look at the trad-wife trend online. The whole aesthetic insists it’s revealing something biologically real about womanhood, the idea that “true” femininity expresses itself through nurturing, softness, homemaking, and submission. However, the performance continues to reveal its flaws. These creators aren’t quietly disappearing into family life; they’re scripting it. They plan shots, build parasocial followings, negotiate sponsorships, and track engagement. They talk about rejecting modernity while leveraging every modern influencer tactic available. In a strange way, their success depends on not actually living the life they’re idealizing, because being a “traditional” wife in private doesn’t pay the bills, but performing that identity at scale does. And that’s where naturalization breaks down: if something is instinctive, it shouldn’t require ring lights, content calendars, and algorithmic discipline to hold it together. The more effort put into making domesticity look effortless, the clearer it becomes that “natural” femininity here is a production, not an inheritance. It doesn’t make their desire for that life invalid; I’m sure some of them would really rather be stay-at-home mothers than build careers, but it does complicate the story. Instead of proving timeless gender truth, the trad-wife genre ends up revealing the machinery behind naturalization itself: how we sell ideas about nature by staging them, repeating them, and branding them until they start to feel inevitable.
