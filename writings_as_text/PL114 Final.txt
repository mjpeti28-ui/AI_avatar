If someone asked me what this class was about, I’d probably say it felt like a long conversation about where our ideas of nature, reality, and God even come from. We moved through many different thinkers, starting with the Greeks seeking to make sense of the world without resorting to myth, then to medieval writers who rebuilt everything around Christianity, and eventually to early scientists and skeptics who began to tug at the threads of those older systems. The point wasn’t really to judge any of them, but to see what they were trying to do and how their worlds shaped the questions they thought were worth asking. Ultimately, the class felt less like a list of philosophers and more like watching different generations struggle with the same fundamental uncertainties we still face today.
We began with the Greeks because they were among the first to try to understand the world without relying entirely on inherited stories. With Socrates, the focus was on not taking anything for granted and treating that kind of questioning as part of living a good life. Plato took that impulse and tried to build a picture of what justice, knowledge, and reality might look like if you trusted reason above everything else. Their answers were ambitious, sometimes impossibly so, but what stood out was the effort to base their explanations on something other than tradition. That set the tone for the rest of the class: whenever an older framework no longer held together, someone sought to build a new one that made sense for their time.
The medieval material felt like a major shift, even though the underlying questions hadn’t changed much. Thinkers such as Anselm, Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Hildegard were still trying to make sense of the world, but Christianity shaped the entire project in a way the Greeks never addressed. Instead of asking whether God existed, they started from the assumption that he did and then tried to show how reason could reinforce that belief. Arguments like Anselm’s logical proof or Aquinas’s five ways were interesting not just for what they claimed, but for what they revealed about the time period. You can see how tightly philosophy was intertwined with the worldview people already lived inside. It wasn’t that the questions had changed; it was that the range of acceptable answers had narrowed.
The early modern readings opened things back up again. Montaigne’s skepticism made it difficult to feel confident in any claim to certainty. Pascal responded to that uncertainty by leaning on faith, while Bacon tried to design a method that avoided the built-in biases of human thinking. Descartes took a different path altogether, breaking everything down through radical doubt and then rebuilding it around reason and the mind, hoping to secure a foundation for both science and theology. After him, we moved to thinkers who started questioning even those foundations: Princess Elizabeth pressing him on how mind and body could ever interact; Cavendish arguing for an entirely material view of the world; Hume testing how far our experience and reasoning can really justify belief in God; and D’Holbach pushing a deterministic picture where nature explains everything on its own. Paley offered almost the opposite reaction, insisting that the order we see in nature must have been designed. By the time we reached Darwin and then Dewey, the whole conversation had shifted again. Darwin showed how natural processes could explain what appeared to be design, and Dewey argued that this forced philosophy to rethink ideas such as purpose, certainty, and even what counts as knowledge. It ended up feeling like a long chain reaction: every time an old explanation stopped working, someone tried to build a new one out of whatever their moment made possible.
I think the thing this class kept pushing me toward was letting go of the idea that the history of thought moves toward anything like clarity. It’s easy to pretend there’s some narrative where religion tried to explain the world, science eventually replaced it, and now we’re in the stage where everything important is basically figured out. But once you start paying attention to the kinds of questions people actually care about, not the technical or solvable ones, but the ones about purpose or meaning or why any of this exists in the first place, that whole story falls apart. Science isn’t built to answer those questions, and religion answers them so directly that it almost feels like it skips over the part where you’re supposed to wrestle with them. Seeing people ask the same questions across thousands of years, each time convinced they’d come closer to something definitive, made it hard to believe there’s a final explanation waiting somewhere down the line. It started to feel like each era builds a framework that works well enough for the moment, until the assumptions holding it together shift and the whole thing opens up again.
What surprised me most was how quickly some of the arguments I had always heard about as major philosophical landmarks started to look less like discoveries and more like artifacts of the time that produced them. It wasn’t that Aquinas or Paley, or even Descartes, were making obviously wrong arguments. They just seemed like people trying to make sense of the world using whatever tools and boundaries they’d inherited. And once I saw that, it became harder to pretend any of these systems were as sturdy or universal as they make themselves out to be. The same thing kept happening with the modern writers. Montaigne, Hume, D’Holbach, Darwin, Dewey; none of them were “fixing” the past so much as exposing a new set of assumptions underneath it. That was what stayed with me: how an argument that feels airtight at first glance can dissolve once you start tracing the conditions that made it feel convincing. It made philosophy seem less like a steady march toward truth and more like a record of people trying to hold onto meaning in whatever way felt possible at the time.
What I probably appreciated most was how uncomfortable that realization is. I grew up assuming that if I wanted to know something badly enough, I could just look it up and get the answer. But the questions we dealt with in this class don’t work like that, and there’s something almost unfair about that. These are the most basic questions about being human, and we don’t get satisfying explanations for any of them. It’s tempting to let religion step in and provide a purpose or plan, and it’s just as tempting to fall into the opposite move and say we’re nothing but biological machinery, so nothing really matters. Both feel like ways of avoiding the harder, less comfortable middle ground: we’re here for a while, we have no idea why, and we have to live inside that uncertainty, whether we like it or not.
If anything shifted for me, it wasn’t that I walked away with a new answer. It was more the sense that not having an answer forces a kind of honesty I did not expect. It makes the present moment feel heavier, and it makes the way we treat ourselves and each other feel like the only real place where meaning shows up at all, even if “meaning” ends up being something we create out of necessity rather than something we uncover. And as much as I still think there’s value in wrestling with these unanswerable questions, I don’t think they need a final purpose behind them to matter. The thinking they force, and the conversations they open up, might be the closest thing to an answer we ever get. That’s probably the part of the class that’s going to stay with me.
