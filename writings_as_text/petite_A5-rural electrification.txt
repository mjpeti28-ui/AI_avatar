Introduction:
Electricity is a technology that today many Americans often take for granted because it seems so inherently ingrained in our daily lives ​​(Chisik, 2011). In general, electricity consumers rarely consider the intricate networks of wires, transmission lines, and power plants that sustain our homes and communities, nor the long and complex journey that brought electricity from a luxury of the wealthy to an essential part of everyday life. The history of rural electrification is about much more than just technology; it is a story of human ambition, regional inequalities, and different visions of progress (Kline, 2000). This paper examines the development of rural electrification in the United States, focusing on how technological innovations, federal intervention, and rural community participation shaped its adoption. It will begin with the transition from gas to electric lighting and the rise of AC power. Next, it analyzes the federal government’s response to the rural-urban electrification divide, focusing on the Rural Electrification Administration and its cooperative model. Finally, it explores the cultural and social transformations driven by electrification, highlighting the interplay between federal policies and local communities.

Background: 
The electrification of America began in earnest in 1879 with Thomas Edison's invention of a commercially viable incandescent lamp. At first, electricity was a luxury only available to or even wanted by wealthy households, industries, and cities that wanted street lights, so rural America remained untouched by this technology for the most part. In 1900, less than 5% of industrial power came from electricity; by 1907, only 8% of homes were electrified (Potter, 2023). Early lighting for the general public was primarily limited to gas lights, which had significant limitations. Mainly, gas was dangerous; the lamps required gas to be openly burned in people’s houses, which brought severe health concerns and was incredibly inefficient. In his research on the early electrical grid, Brian Potter, a structural engineer, adds that gas lamps simply had an ugly yellow-green color, and the gas itself would slowly discolor the lamp, eventually requiring a replacement. Arc lights solved some of these problems, but because they were just two nodes passing electricity back and forth, they were dangerous and required so much power that they were only practical for industries and city street lights. Incandescent lighting, a method of heating a filament until it glowed, was considered the solution, but a commercially viable version had not been made (Potter, 2023). In 1879, Edison solved that problem with his incandescent lamp, which brought a safe and practical electric home lighting system and the potential for country-wide illumination if only the country had a reliable power distribution system.
Edison established centralized power stations powered by coal steam engines to address the lack of power distribution. These stations lit thousands of his bulbs within a small radius, making electric light competitive with gas. By 1886, his company had built 58 central stations and 702 smaller stations, eventually serving over 300,000 lamps (Potter, 2023). Despite the success of his stations, there were clear inefficiencies in Edison's model that made them only viable in urban centers, leaving rural America behind in the adoption of electrical power. These inefficiencies highlighted the need for a better power distribution system to allow for more electricity access.
The desire for scalability in power distribution sparked the "War of the Currents." Edison's direct current (DC) system could only transmit power efficiently over short distances because it only allowed for electricity to flow in one direction (Potter, 2023). In contrast, the alternating current (AC) system, championed by Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, allowed electricity to flow in both directions and used transformers to adjust the voltage for long-distance transmission (Potter, 2023). This innovation made AC particularly well-suited to serve regions beyond the dense urban center. Tesla’s invention of the AC induction motor and Westinghouse’s investment in AC technology further solidified its advantages, leading to a rapid shift toward AC power by the early 20th century (Potter, 2023).
While the technical capacity to deliver electricity to rural areas existed, utilities prioritized urban centers with higher profit margins. General Electric’s 1921 cartogram, which resized states based on electricity access, vividly illustrates this divide. New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois dominated the map, while rural states were reduced to minuscule proportions. General Electric published statistics on electrification along with the cartogram at the time. By 1921, only 57.3% of the U.S. had electricity, with urban areas like Washington, D.C., and Massachusetts nearing 99% electrification (Gallant, 2018). Meanwhile, rural areas were left behind; by the early 1920s, only 2-3% of farms had electricity, often limited to elite farmers near highways (Gallant, 2018). Profit-driven priorities left much of rural America in the dark, demonstrating that the lack of rural electrification was not a matter of technological limitation but of economic strategy.
 Despite Edison's attempts to advocate for DC power because he thought it was safer than AC and had already heavily invested in it, the advantages of AC power, especially in reaching rural and less dense areas, allowed it to overtake DC power quickly. By 1900, 43% of power stations used AC, and by 1917, AC had become the dominant standard, even with innovations like the rotary converter, allowing the two systems to work together (Potter, 2023). AC power was revolutionary for technology and changed how people thought about electricity nationally. It made mass electrification seem achievable, given that the necessary infrastructure could be built. However, it took targeted efforts later in the century to extend this dream to rural communities, where the market had long deprioritized electrification.​​ 
Transmission lines and power plants became the two vital pieces of infrastructure to achieve the dream of mass electrification. AC power allowed for long-distance, cost-efficient electricity transmission to be a reality. Many historians of early electrification emphasize that AC power was particularly revolutionary because it allowed power plants, especially remote hydroelectric plants, to provide electricity to vast land areas (Potter, 2023; Jeter et al., 2018; Tuttle et al., 2016). The adoption of AC power into the existing energy system happened rapidly. In 1889, the US's first long-distance DC transmission line connected a waterfall to an arc lighting system in Portland. A year later, an AC line was constructed in the same spot, signaling a shift. By 1900, the US had 15 high-voltage transmission lines to hydroelectric power plants, including the landmark Edward Dean Adams plant at Niagara Falls. This trend continued, and by 1912, the US had 225 hydroelectric power stations, with 49 of the world's 55 high-voltage lines connected to these sources (Potter, 2023). This transformation was pivotal for rural electrification, as it made large-scale transmission possible, eventually setting the foundation for even the most isolated communities to gain access to electricity.
The growth of AC power infrastructure, mainly its ability to transmit electricity long distance, enabled electrification to expand beyond urban centers and into new applications. Incandescent lighting drove the initial demand for electricity, with an estimated 18 million lamps in use by 1902, a 500% increase over 12 years (Potter, 2023). However, electricity quickly expanded beyond lighting. Electric streetcars, for example, grew from 35 miles of track in 1887 to over 22,000 miles by 1902, becoming the second largest electricity consumer after lighting (Potter, 2023). Although industry lagged in adopting electricity, by 1914, it supplied 40% of mechanical power in factories, making steam engines increasingly obsolete (Potter, 2023). It seemed clear that once electricity was an option, it would be taken advantage of. Moreso, the versatility of AC power also enabled a "universal" system: power could be generated centrally, transmitted at high voltage, and then reduced for end users. This system was the key to an interconnected electric grid.  By 1902, the US had over 3,600 central generating plants; a decade later, 5,000 plants powered 75 million bulbs (Potter, 2023). As demand grew, the need for larger, more efficient power plants increased, giving rise to steam turbines and high-voltage transmission networks that shaped the industry into a system dominated by state-regulated utility monopolies. The expansion of high-voltage AC transmission lines enabled power to be efficiently transported long distances, directly making it feasible to extend services to rural areas, given enough economic incentive for utility companies. Nonetheless, the infrastructure could support integrating isolated rural communities into the broader electrified society by bridging the infrastructural gap.
Despite the rapid growth of the energy industry and the expansion of what would eventually become the modern electric grid, rural homes and farms remained in the dark. Most electric companies believed that building transmission lines to serve low-density rural communities, especially farms, was too costly (Kline, 2000). The high cost of constructing transmission lines, about $2,000 per mile, and the sparse population density of rural areas meant that electric companies saw little financial incentive (Dobbs, 2016). Tim Sabik, a senior economics writer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, emphasizes that private power companies viewed rural electrification as a “losing proposition,” highlighting both economic inefficiencies and the logistical hurdles of extending service (Sablik, 2020). The inefficiencies of rural electrification were inherent to its rural nature: farms spread out by miles of farmland required a higher ratio of transmission lines to customers, which was not profitable enough for the companies. This economic reality led to a significant delay in extending electricity to rural communities, resulting in a growing disparity between urban and rural America. 
Nevertheless, the demand for electricity in these areas was undeniable. Rural people often longed for the benefits of electrification and needed a viable means of obtaining it (Kline, 2000). Robert Kline, a historian of technology and expert on rural electrification, argues that many people believed electricity would transform "dark, drab farmhouses into bright, suburban utopias, where the ancient foes of isolation and drudgery would be banished forever" (Kline, 2000, p.g. 2). Meade Ferguson, the chair of home economics at the National Grange – a significant organization that supported farmers' economic and political interests – echoed this sentiment. In a nationwide radio address in 1935, he declared, "Adequate electric current for farmhouses will mean the emancipation of farm women from the endless household drudgeries which they have borne for too long" (Kline, 2000). Whether or not this perspective was universally held or completely accurate, it reflected the common aspiration for progress that electricity appeared to promise (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015). Despite a general desire for electrification, it remained almost entirely inaccessible, deepening rural discontent already present during the Great Depression.
The Great Depression, a period of severe economic hardship in the U.S. marked by widespread unemployment, bank failures, and industrial decline, only exacerbated the divide between rural people and private companies. In this context of insecurity and suffering, there was a growing demand for government intervention (Dobbs, 2021). Franklin Roosevelt capitalized on this sentiment during his campaign in 1932, proposing the New Deal as a revolutionary solution to the economic crisis. The New Deal agenda –a series of progressive social programs and policies aimed to create jobs and build public trust in the federal government –was sold as a solution to the Great Depression. Its immediate implementation and impact under the Roosevelt administration provided relief and signaled a fundamental shift in the federal government’s role, specifically in addressing inequities like the rural-urban divide (2021).  
One of the most transformative programs introduced under the New Deal was the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), established in 1935 by Executive Order 7037. The REA recognized the disparities between rural and urban electrification and sought to address the divide by providing low-interest loans to fund the creation of electrical infrastructure. The program emphasized the cooperative model, where rural communities collectively owned and managed their own electric utilities. This paper will explore the complex relationship between rural communities and the REA and highlight its transformative role in reshaping rural America.

STS frames:
	
	The disparity between rural and urban electrification directly resulted from private economic strategies at the time, demonstrating how economic policy determined and shaped who had access to electricity; thus, private companies' pursuit of profit actively reinforced inequalities rather than addressing technological gaps.  (Jeter et al., 2018). Urban areas did not have electricity as early as rural ones because they wanted it more or because the technology was not good enough to support the low density of rural America. Instead, private companies actively chose not to expand electrification simply because they saw it as not profitable enough (Jeter et al., 2018). Rural electrification was entirely viable because of AC power at this point, yet utilities continued to funnel resources to urban centers with higher returns. The private sector did not just refuse to expand their transmission lines but actively worked against rural electrification. Private utility companies took steps to protect their financial interests and avoid addressing rural electrification seriously. This profit-driven exclusion of rural America from expansion reveals that electrification was not solely a technical challenge but a sociotechnical issue shaped by market priorities.
	The formation of the Committee on the Relation of Electricity to Agriculture (CREA) exemplifies how private companies’ pursuit of profit reinforced inequalities in rural electrification rather than addressing technological gaps (Kline, 2000). Funded by private utilities and composed of representatives from farm organizations and electrical industries, CREA conducted research ostensibly aimed at proving the value of electricity on farms. However, public power groups accused CREA of crafting biased research to undermine the REA and sway agricultural leaders against government intervention. For example, CREA promoted the narrative that electrification was a luxury rather than a necessity, which protected private companies’ financial interests while obstructing rural access (Kline, 2000). This deliberate framing shaped sociotechnical systems by justifying inaction in rural areas, delaying electrification compared to other similarly developed countries (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015).
	Private utilities actively resisted equitable solutions by maintaining control over the narrative, leveraging political strategies to obstruct federal initiatives like the REA. Historians now attribute significant delays in rural electrification to CREA’s influence, highlighting how these economic structures deepened existing inequalities (Alatout & Schelly, 2010; Kitchens & Fishback, 2015; Kline, 2000). CREA’s impact illustrates how sociotechnical systems are not shaped by technological limitations alone but by the deliberate efforts of stakeholders to prioritize profit over equitable access.
	Additionally, the actions of individuals like Emil Lehman demonstrate how private economic policies shaped the sociotechnical system of electrification by influencing access to electricity and framing its role in rural life. In 1928, while employed by a private utility company, Lehmann conducted research using selective data to claim that electricity significantly reduced women’s housework despite conflicting evidence (Kline, 2000). This narrative, which portrayed electrification as a convenience for housewives rather than a critical need for rural modernization, marginalized rural communities by downplaying the broader significance of electrification. Private companies justified their inaction in extending rural infrastructure by framing electricity as a consumer luxury rather than an essential utility, reinforcing systemic inequalities.
	In contrast to the narrative portrayed by CREA, the REA emphasized electricity’s transformative potential, highlighting over 200 applications for farm productivity, such as cooled milk storage and spray irrigation (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015). Still, while working for CREA, Lehmann's later attempts to discredit the Bureau of Home Economics’s findings that electrical appliances did not necessarily save housework time further illustrated their deliberate strategy to withhold electrical access from rural communities (Kline, 2000). These actions reveal how economic incentives shaped cultural narratives, creating perceptions aligned with corporate interests rather than addressing rural needs. This phenomenon underscores how sociotechnical systems were shaped by political and economic frames, revealing who benefited from technological progress and who was excluded.
	In response to the private sector's continued failure to address rural needs, Franklin Roosevelt’s administration recognized that economic strategies and market forces alone were insufficient to bring electricity to rural America, promoting the implementation of political policies to address the disparity (Jeter et al., 2018). As part of his broader New Deal agenda, Roosevelt prioritized improving the quality of life for rural communities, particularly farmers. While these efforts aimed to enhance farm efficiency and productivity by adopting technologies like electricity, they also extended to broader goals such as improving education, health, leisure, and cultural access (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). By addressing these dimensions, federal policies sought to reshape sociotechnical systems, counterbalancing the structural inequities perpetuated by private economic strategies.
	Government intervention became the only viable solution due to the private sector’s unwillingness to act. This intervention highlights how political policies can transform access to technology, emphasizing equity over profit and reinforcing the role of government in reducing systemic disparities.
	The establishment of the REA in 1935 marked a pivotal moment in addressing the disparities in access to electricity, reshaping sociotechnical systems to prioritize equity over profit (Sablik, 2020). By extending low-interest loans and fostering the creation of cooperatives, the REA shifted electrification control to rural communities, enabling them to participate directly in their own infrastructure. The impact of this approach is evident in the dramatic growth of transmission lines: By 1940, cooperatives constructed over 250,000 miles of distribution lines, connecting more than 956,000 farms, more than double the number electrified in 1935 (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015). This shift in who had power in electrification dramatically shaped the sociotechnical system itself.
	A key driver of this expansion was the reduction in the cost of rural transmission lines from $2,000 per mile to $850, achieved through bulk purchasing agreements and more efficient construction techniques developed by REA engineers. This innovation demonstrates how political policies can reshape economic incentives, making large-scale electrification affordable and accessible to previously excluded rural communities. Empirical research by Kitchens and Fishback highlights the REA’s broader impact, showing that the program substantially increased crop output per acre and farm while mitigating long-term declines in farm numbers and land value (2015). These findings underscore how the REA’s policies not only extended access to electricity but also achieved economic and social goals, boosting rural productivity and stability during a period of crisis.
	By aligning federal intervention with economic growth, the REA exemplified how government policies can counter the limitations of private market forces, creating systems that prioritize collective benefit. The cooperative model, central to the REA’s strategy, bypassed the profit-driven barriers of private utilities and empowered rural communities to shape their own electrification effort. In doing so, the REA fundamentally transformed the sociotechnical landscape, demonstrating that equitable access to technology is possible when government policies are designed to reduce systemic disparities and foster local agency.
	While the REA’s policies successfully expanded access to electricity, they did not grant unconditional autonomy to rural communities. The cooperative model empowered local participation, but the REA imposed strict regulations to ensure financial accountability, reflecting an economic frame designed to protect federal investments. For example, the REA controlled key aspects of cooperative operations, such as hiring decisions and material selection, limiting local autonomy (Cannon, 2000). In one instance, the REA rejected all nominees for a superintendent position at Moon Lake Electric in Utah, citing a lack of qualifications, illustrating the top-down nature of its oversight. Communities that failed to meet the REA’s standards risked losing access altogether, as seen when the Riverton Cooperative in Wyoming was forced to merge with Midvale Light and Power under the threat of funding withdrawal (Cannon, 2000).
	This tension between extending access and maintaining federal oversight highlights the trade-offs inherent in reshaping sociotechnical systems. Although government intervention successfully addressed rural disparities, it introduced a new form of control that shaped who benefited from electrification and under what conditions. From a political perspective, these policies ensured alignment with national goals, even at the expense of local independence. By 1939, cooperative utilities had surpassed the five largest private utilities in transmission line mileage, demonstrating the effectiveness of the cooperative model despite its constraints (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015).
	The long-term impact of these cooperatives underscores how political policies reshaped rural electrification while institutionalizing federal influence over rural energy systems. Today, cooperatives serve over 42 million people across 47 states, maintaining 42% of the nation’s distribution lines and delivering 11% of all electricity (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015). This legacy demonstrates that while federal policies created infrastructure addressing inequalities, they also exemplified the complex balance of equity and control. The political and economic policies ultimately defined where electricity was available and under what terms, revealing the intricate balance required to shape equitable sociotechnical systems.
	The success of rural electrification was not just about policies or programs; it depended on a back-and-forth between rural communities and the federal government. Electrification was not a one-sided process where the REA dictated the terms and rural people simply followed along, nor did local initiative completely drive it without federal influence. Instead, it was a constant negotiation shaped by the goals and motivations of both sides. To understand how rural electrification happened, it is essential to examine how these sociotechnical interactions shaped the cooperative system and the process as a whole.
	Examining the REA’s influence begins with analyzing its motives and the broader U.S. government's goals at the time. In the early 1900s, despite emerging as a global power after World War 1, America was still shaping its identity and governance (Eisenberg, 2021). Before the Great Depression, individualism and laissez-faire economics dominated, but the instability of the 1930s pushed the nation toward something new (2021). FDR’s New Deal, introduced after his election in 1932, aimed to reshape American views on social programs, community, and economics (Eisenberg, 2021). Rural spaces, in particular, offered a unique opportunity for this transformation.
	Scholars Nasser Alatout, an expert in how technology, policy, and space intersect, and Chelsea Schelly, who studies the societal impacts of sustainable systems, analyze the REA through Michel Foucault’s concepts of biopolitics and governmentality (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). Their work sheds valuable light on the deeper motives behind the federal government’s approach to rural electrification. Altaut and Schelly suggest that the federal government’s motives for rural electrification can be understood through biopolitics and governmentality (2010). As Foucault’s theories suggest, government eventually extends beyond laws or territorial control; it involves shaping populations and their relationships with infrastructure, space, and each other. Altaut and Schelly argue that the New Deal represented a pivotal moment in this shift, using technologies like electrification to redefine rural America (2010). Rural electrification’s development into a sociotechnical system made it not just about improving farm efficiency or reducing labor; it became part of a broader effort to modernize rural spaces, integrate them into the national economy, and align rural lifestyles with the government’s vision of modern citizenship (2010).
	FDR’s administration saw rural America as both a challenge and an opportunity. Electrification offered a way to address tangible problems like farm productivity and rural isolation, but it also allowed the government to establish a stronger connection to rural populations. By providing centralized power, the REA brought technology to these areas and redefined what it meant to be rural (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). Through policies, loans, and education campaigns, the government framed electrification as essential for economic survival and participation in modern American society (Kline, 2000). They effectively created a new biopolitical concept of rural living aligned with the government's two motives: improving rural livelihoods and creating a population that fits into its broader vision for a unified and governable nation. 
The government’s motives consequentially shaped the narrative they constructed around electrification. By framing pre-electrification rural life as anti-modern and burdened with drudgery, in stark contrast to the modern efficiencies of electrified urban America, the REA positioned electrification as the essential solution to these problems (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). This narrative is best embodied in the Utilization Division of the REA, a branch dedicated explicitly to traveling around rural America to demonstrate the transformative power of electrification by showcasing home appliances and farm equipment (Kline, 2000). 
One of the Utilization Division’s hallmark initiatives was the Farm Equipment Tour. This traveling fair showcased the benefits of electricity while also appealing to rural traditions of local carnivals and even humor (2000). The way electrical demonstrations were structured even reflected the REA’s goal of aligning rural society with broader American ideals of modernity. Gendered presentations targeted men with agricultural equipment, such as water pumps and milking machines, and women with domestic appliances, like washing machines and electric irons (Kline, 2000). By tying electrification to efficiency, comfort, and modernization concepts, the REA sought to redefine rural life, making it more cohesive with the national vision of progress (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). This effort was a direct example of governmentality in action, as the REA was attempting to extend its influence on rural communities by creating self-governing agents in favor of electrification for modernization among that very population. 
Building on the government’s narrative about rural electrification, the REA also played a critical role in redefining rural spaces. Electrification was more than a technical solution; it was a way to make rural America governable and economically viable (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). During congressional hearings about the REA, Morris Cooke, the agency’s leader, highlighted how the government approached the concept of “rural” as something ambiguous and often defined in opposition to urban and suburban spaces (Kline, 2000). This ambiguity stemmed from the diverse and scattered nature of rural areas, especially farms, making it difficult to plan infrastructure for and legislate. For the REA, understanding rural spaces through precise definitions was not just about semantics but about making these areas compatible with policymaking. Alatout and Schelly argue that by framing rural communities as distinct yet essential parts of the nation, the government used electrification to create a new connection between population and territory (Alatout & Schelly, 2010). The physical embodiments of electrification, transmission lines, power plants, and the cooperatives themselves formed a connection that allowed the REA to define where rural communities were, their demographics, and what infrastructure they had, which would allow them to later legislate and control those same areas.
Despite the REA’s attempts to depict rural people as desperately begging for and needing electricity, rural communities did not welcome the cooperative system with open arms. The REA understood that it could not just force policies on cooperatives; workers and local communities had to genuinely believe in the system for it to take root and have the intended effect. Convincing people involved significantly more than just constructing transmission lines; it required persuading rural communities to embrace a completely different lifestyle. While many wanted electricity, they were not blindly on board with the cooperative model (Kline, 2000). Concerns over financial risk, government overreach, and whether the system would actually deliver on its promises created significant tension. The REA’s efforts to overcome these sociotechnical tensions eventually became what defined how it operated and how rural America was transformed.
Financial risk was the most significant barrier preventing rural communities from fully embracing the REA’s cooperative system. For many farmers, particularly during the Great Depression, even seemingly cheap membership fees posed a challenge, with some unable to afford the typical $5 required to join a cooperative (Cannon, 2000). On top of that, the fear of failure loomed large. Farmers saw cooperatives as risky ventures, and many worried that if a cooperative defaulted on its loans, members could lose their farms or face financial ruin (Cannon, 2000). Private utility companies did not help, using propaganda to paint cooperatives as unstable and unreliable, further discouraging participation (Cannon, 2000). This tension forced the REA to adjust its approach, addressing financial concerns directly to gain rural communities' trust. Offering low-interest loans, often between 2.7% and 3%, the REA made electrification projects far more affordable than private financing options, which often came with rates of at least 6% (Kitchens & Fishback, 2015). The REA also focused on cutting costs whenever possible, developing innovative construction methods to reduce the transmission line cost from $2,000 per mile to as low as $850 by the late 1930s (Sablik, 2020). The REA understood that the price associated with the technology of electrification was prohibitive, so they worked to reduce the cost of the technology and its means of construction instead of trying to change how rural citizens viewed the technology. This active effort by the REA, viewed through a social negotiation frame, shows that the improvements in how electrification was constructed and funded were not due to the REA’s initiative but because the wants and needs of rural communities actively shaped them.
Still, financial anxiety shaped how rural people interacted with the cooperative system. Some refused to sign up due to fears of losing money if the cooperative failed. In contrast, others were put off by minimum outlet requirements or chose to prioritize other needs, like building gravel roads over electricity (Cannon, 2000). These concerns were not just economic; they reflected a broader skepticism about whether the government’s promises would hold up in practice. This dynamic highlights how financial risks impacted the REA's policies and how electrification developed, influenced as much by local circumstances as the government's overall vision.
Concerns about government overreach also shaped how rural communities responded to the REA’s electrification efforts. While the cooperative model was built on the promise of local control, the REA imposed strict regulations to ensure its loans were repaid and the projects were successful. This oversight often felt overbearing to rural residents, who saw it as an intrusion on their autonomy. For instance, the REA required cooperatives to seek approval for key decisions, from hiring superintendents to choosing construction materials, limiting the independence of these organizations (Cannon, 2000). On many occasions, cooperatives disagreed with REA regulations and petitioned or sued for exceptions (Kline, 2000). The REA operated with limited resources, which meant it occasionally allowed cooperatives to deviate from its rules if they presented a strong enough case. However, they still held their trump card of withholding funds when necessary, a tactic that frequently led to lawsuits from cooperatives challenging REA decisions. In many of these cases, the REA eventually relented, further underscoring the negotiation present in the process. In one case, the REA rejected all nominees for a superintendent position at Moon Lake Electric in Utah, deeming them unqualified. In another, the Riverton Cooperative in Wyoming was forced to merge with Midvale Light and Power under threat of losing funding (Cannon, 2000). By balancing rural autonomy and federal oversight, a tangible sense of negotiation was created that allowed the REA to maintain the regulations it felt were necessary. Still, these interventions frustrated many rural people who wanted electricity but resented the strings attached to it.
At the same time, the REA’s close involvement ensured that cooperatives operated efficiently and met the technical and financial demands of rural electrification. This balancing act, offering rural communities the tools to modernize while tightly controlling how those tools were used, created significant tension. The REA’s policies reflected the government’s broader goals of modernization and standardization, but for many rural residents, it felt like trading one inequality for another. Even as electrification brought undeniable benefits, it also reinforced the idea that rural America had to fit into the government’s vision of what progress should look like. These tensions, examined through the social negotiation frame, highlight how government overreach shaped the cooperative system and electrification itself. Without the back and forth, the cooperative model would have likely included too much oversight and failed to connect with rural people. The REA’s oversight ensured the program’s success, but it came at the cost of local autonomy, leaving rural people to navigate both the benefits and the frustrations of centralized control.
The REA’s efforts to electrify rural America went far beyond providing cooperatives the means and regulations; it actively shaped how rural communities lived, worked, and engaged with modernity. This was most evident in the REA’s cultural and promotional strategies, which aimed to integrate electricity into the fabric of rural life. The REA redefined rural communities' relationship with technology and modern living through education campaigns, partnerships with appliance dealers, and local celebrations.
One of the most explicit ways the REA deliberately influenced rural life was through “powering-on” celebrations. These events marked the activation of new power lines with symbolic rituals like “funerals” for kerosene lamps or smashing them against the newly built electric poles (Kline, 2000). For many, these celebrations represented progress and the end of isolation, but for others, they symbolized the government’s push to replace traditional values with a new vision of modernity (Kline, 2000). These events underscored the REA’s desire to create a cultural narrative around electrification as a transformative force.
To ensure electricity became a practical and sustainable part of rural life, the REA encouraged the adoption of appliances that could showcase electricity’s labor-saving and economic benefits. As mentioned earlier, the REA’s Utilization Division organized events like the Farm Equipment Tour with gendered presentations to persuade people to electrify and encourage those with electricity to use more. Furthermore, these efforts framed electricity as essential for productivity, comfort, and convenience, linking rural life to broader consumer culture.
The REA also worked to strengthen the infrastructure supporting rural electrification by fostering relationships with appliance dealers. It incentivized dealers to offer discounts or promotions to rural customers and encouraged them to stock appliances tailored to farm life. In some cases, the REA even stepped in to fill gaps where dealers were unwilling to deliver appliances to remote areas or considered rural customers too costly to serve (Kline, 2000). These interventions helped shift the perception of electricity from a luxury to a necessity, ensuring its long-term viability in rural communities.
Additionally, the REA encouraged cooperatives to foster a sense of community around electrification by creating local magazines and newsletters. By 1941, 500 out of 1,500 cooperatives published monthly newsletters, often including appliance recommendations, farming tips, and updates on cooperative projects (Kline, 2000). These publications reflected local cultures and reinforced the REA’s modernization message, helping to normalize electricity’s role in rural life.
Through these efforts, the REA provided more than electricity; it reshaped rural life. Its initiatives promoted new ways of thinking about technology, labor, and progress while creating a shared cultural identity centered around electrification. By connecting rural communities to national consumer culture, the REA redefined what it meant to live in rural America, leaving a lasting legacy far beyond installing power lines. One that the government hoped would invigorate the rural economy, which would, in turn, help bring all of America out of the Great Depression and simultaneously give the government a physical connection to rural spaces that would allow them to influence those populations in a way they had not before. 
Analyzing the development of the REA’s rural electrification system through the lens of social negotiation helps explain its ultimate success. It reveals how the government achieved its goal of integrating rural Americans into the broader nation while rural communities gained access to lighting, convenience, and modernization without completely losing their autonomy. This frame highlights how the process was shaped by a series of back-and-forth negotiations, resulting in a sociotechnical system that balanced the needs and goals of both sides.

Conclusion:

	The story of rural electrification is a profound example of how technological progress is not just a matter of engineering but an inherently social, economic, and political negotiation. When the REA was created, it stepped into a vacuum left by private utilities that viewed rural America as unprofitable and unimportant. The economic calculus of the market left millions in rural areas isolated and disconnected from the benefits of modernity despite advances in AC technology that made electrification technically feasible. The federal government’s intervention through the REA was not just an act of economic relief but a deliberate attempt to redefine rural America as a connected and productive part of the national fabric. However, this transformation was neither simple nor one-sided. An ongoing dialogue between federal goals, local realities, and the persistent tension between modernization and autonomy defined the process.
	The REA’s efforts extended far beyond building infrastructure. Electrification was framed as a cultural and social project redefining rural life as modern, efficient, and aligned with broader American consumer values. Programs like the Farm Equipment Tour, cooperative newsletters, and powering-on celebrations did not just promote the utility of electricity; they embedded it into the identity of rural communities. These initiatives were designed to sell the practical benefits of electrification and its symbolism, making electricity represent a bridge between the isolation of the past and the promise of the future. Through these campaigns, the REA presented electricity as essential to progress, not just for the economy but for the bedrock of rural culture.
	Still, rural communities were not just passive recipients of the REA’s vision. They played an active role in shaping how electrification happened, making sure it fit their priorities and values. The cooperative model was at the heart of this pushback. It gave rural people a sense of ownership and local control, but it also came with strings attached. The REA’s strict rules, covering everything from hiring to the types of construction materials, often clashed with the independence rural communities valued. When conflicts arose, communities did not just relent; they pushed back with petitions, lawsuits, and public pressure. This resistance was not just about rejecting federal oversight but about fighting for a say in their future.
	For its part, the REA showed a willingness to adapt. While it maintained the power to withhold funds as a last resort, it often relented when cooperatives made strong cases for exceptions to the rules. This dynamic of give-and-take underscored the deeply negotiated nature of rural electrification. The REA’s success was in providing electricity and finding a balance between enforcing its vision and allowing rural communities to shape it in relevant and sustainable ways. This process transformed electrification from a top-down imposition into a collaborative effort that reflected the diversity and complexity of rural life.
	The story of rural electrification has a lot to teach us about tackling modern issues like the digital divide. Like in the 1930s, when power companies focused on cities and wealthier areas, private internet providers today leave rural communities behind, prioritizing profit over access (Cain et al., 2022). Fixing this gap is not just about better technology but about taking a holistic approach, as the REA did. That means combining infrastructure with cultural outreach, involving local communities, and crafting policies that put equality ahead of profits. The REA treated electricity as essential for modern life, and we need to start thinking of broadband similarly. The digital divide is much more than a tech issue; it is a social one, and solving it will take the same kind of innovation, investment, and collaboration that made rural electrification successful.
	At the same time, rural electrification reminds us of the limits of even the most well-meaning government programs. While this paper has touched on how private utilities contributed to the electrification gap, there is still a lot to unpack about their role after the REA was established. Private companies did not just disappear; they remained key players, shaping access and infrastructure in ways that often opposed the REA’s goals. Digging deeper into these dynamics would give a more layered understanding of how public and private forces interacted during rural electrification. It is also worth examining today, especially as we consider the role of private corporations in modern infrastructure, from broadband to renewable energy.
	Ultimately, rural electrification was about far more than lightbulbs and power lines; it was about redefining rural America’s place in the nation. It connected isolated communities to the country's broader social and economic networks, but it did so through negotiation rather than imposition. The REA’s success lay in its ability to foster compromise, allowing rural people to shape electrification as they saw fit while embracing the possibilities of modernization. As we face new challenges, the lessons of rural electrification remind us that progress is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It requires collaboration, adaptability, and a willingness to prioritize the needs of those most affected. The question moving forward is whether we will make those investments again. Rural electrification shows us what is possible when government, technology, and communities work together. However, it also warns us of what happens when progress is driven solely by profit and efficiency; it encourages and entrenches inequality, and opportunities for progressive transformation are lost. If we take the lessons of electrification seriously, we can build a future that is not just more connected but more equitable, one where progress is defined not by who is cheapest or easiest to serve but by who needs it most. What remains to be seen is whether we have the will or political environment to learn from this history and apply it to the challenges of our own time.
