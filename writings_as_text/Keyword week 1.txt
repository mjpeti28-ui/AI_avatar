The keyword I chose is cliché. Dumit draws on Deleuze to describe cliché as more than just an overused phrase. It is a patterned way of seeing that makes the world feel manageable even when it is filled with poverty, violence, and inequality. Dumit writes, “The universal myth here is that most comfortable of epistemic objects, a cliché, a story that should be redundant yet whose enjoyment and function is to be repeated: the comfort of a McDonald’s in times of peace and war. And weaving though our lives from start to finish, clichés are part of us” (Dumit, 2014, p. 347). In other words, clichés are not just empty expressions. They are stories and images that we repeat because they are comfortable, even when they cover up or simplify deeper truths. Dumit pushes the idea further when he notes that “our eyes are open, but we perceive only clichés, ‘only what we are interested in perceiving’” (Dumit, 2014, p. 347). That makes clichés less about laziness and more about limits. They tell us not only what we see, but also what we don’t. In that sense, clichés are powerful because they act like filters that shape our perception, making unbearable contradictions look tolerable. They smooth out the world so it feels coherent, even if that coherence comes at the cost of ignoring what is actually in front of us.
You can see this idea of cliché clearly in advertising, especially with brands that sell not just a product but a lifestyle. Take car commercials, for example. The car is almost always framed as freedom: winding roads, open skies, no traffic in sight. It is the same story over and over, yet most of us don’t even notice how repetitive it is. But applying Dumit’s definition, the point of that repetition is not to tell us something new. It is to keep feeding us the same cliché until we believe it. The cliché of “the car equals freedom” hides the less comfortable realities of cars: oil dependence, environmental damage, and urban sprawl. It works the same way Deleuze describes when he says, “we perceive only clichés.” We end up seeing freedom instead of pollution, individuality instead of traffic. Thinking about it this way makes it clear why Dumit finds clichés so powerful. They let us live inside contradictions without having to resolve them, and they turn political and economic problems into background scenery.
