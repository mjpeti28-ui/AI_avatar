Built to Divide: Technology, Race, and Gender in the Single-family House

When people say “technology,” they usually mean machines or gadgets, but that definition is too narrow. Technology is not simply a tool; it is the network of choices, systems, and values embedded in everyday life. Winner argues that artifacts are never neutral, since their design directs human behavior (Winner, 1980). Sinclair demonstrates that race and technology have been inextricably intertwined, meaning that ordinary objects often carry histories of exclusion (Sinclair, 2004). Dumit offers a method for exposing these layers, examining how something is made, from what, in what context, and with what meanings (Dumit, 2014). In short, technology organizes life while concealing the politics that shape it.
The artifact I will focus on is the single-family suburban house. Although it may seem too ordinary to be considered technology, following Winner and Dumit reveals that it does more than just provide shelter. It structures behavior, enforcing ideals of privacy, property, and independence. The house cannot be separated from zoning laws, housing policy, and real estate markets. It packages social norms into wood and concrete, encoding ideas about who belongs, what family should look like, and how life ought to be organized. 
I grew up in such a house, with a yard and driveway, each family sealed within its own unit. It felt natural, but that sense of “normal” was itself engineered. The suburban ideal taught me to associate independence with ownership and privacy with virtue. Only later, through Rothstein and Sinclair, did I understand that this comfort depended on systems that excluded others (Rothstein, 2017; Sinclair, 2004). My personal connection to the house is inseparable from its political history.
To understand it as a technology, Dumit’s method helps us “implode” the object by examining its hidden layers. The suburban home is the product of labor, materials, spatial contexts, and symbolic meanings that reinforce one another. Moving from the physical to the ideological reveals how something so familiar is saturated with politics, history, and power.
	The suburban house is the product of layered systems of labor. At the most immediate level, its construction depends on the physical work of carpenters, electricians, plumbers, roofers, and many other trades. These workers do not appear in isolation; their participation is shaped by unions, licensing systems, and hiring practices that define who is allowed to perform skilled building work and under what conditions. As Sinclair notes, “new technologies constantly force the renegotiation of racialized work” (Sinclair, 2004, p. 9); the building trades are no exception. Access to these jobs has historically been restricted, with labor hierarchies determining who performed skilled tasks and who was relegated to low-wage or high-risk work.
	Beyond the trades, another form of labor sustains the suburban house: the bureaucratic and financial work of developers, contractors, and federal agencies. Rothstein details how the New Deal created entire stages of housing production, from Federal Housing Administration-backed loans to large-scale suburban development (Rothstein, 2017). Builders, bankers, and policymakers became integral to the labor system, influencing zoning decisions, drafting contracts, and distributing credit. In this sense, the suburban house travels not only through construction sites but also through offices, boardrooms, and government agencies.
	Taken together, the labor of the suburban house is not just the act of hammering wood into place. It encompasses skilled trades, institutional labor in policy and finance, and, as we will discuss later, gendered domestic work. Each stage marks the house as a technology produced through overlapping systems of work.
However, labor alone does not explain the house; it is also made of materials that have their own histories and consequences, especially environmental ones. The bulk of a home’s climate impact comes not from how it is used but from the materials it is made of. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a non-profit organization focused on finding market-friendly renewable energy solutions, the processes of extracting raw materials, manufacturing them, and assembling them into building products make up 65–85% of a home’s total embodied carbon, which are emissions released before the house is ever occupied. Transporting and installing those materials adds 5–10% each, while the method of disposal, whether through recycling, landfills, or incineration, contributes an additional 3–15% (RMI, 2022). In fact, this “front-loaded” carbon cost can equal 20–60 years of the energy a house would use once occupied (RMI, 2022). 
Additionally, the choice of materials makes a huge difference. For exterior cladding alone, brick carries about 8,880 kg of embodied carbon, while vinyl siding ranges between 1,000 and 2,000 kg, and engineered wood can be as low as 520 kg (RMI, 2022). In other words, the environmental footprint of a suburban house is locked in long before the first family turns on the lights. The house can thus be understood as an artifact of ecological and political significance based solely on the materials it is made of. 
	The suburban house does not stand in isolation; it appears in landscapes carefully arranged to structure everyday life. Rows of houses line cul-de-sacs, each paired with a car, a yard, and a school district. These routines of commuting, shopping, yard work, and schooling make the house legible not just as a shelter but as the center of suburban life. However, these contexts are deeply political. As Rothstein shows, federal policies and institutions like the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) loan rules and redlining tied neighborhood “stability” to racial homogeneity, even approving physical barriers to separate Black and white areas (Rothstein, 2017).
Furthermore, as Smith and Stovall argue, schools in redeveloped neighborhoods were not neutral community institutions but active tools of containment. Under Chicago’s Plan for Transformation, neighborhood schools were rebranded as selective academies or magnets, explicitly designed to attract middle-class residents while screening out poor families through admissions tests and enrollment caps (Smith & Stovall, 2008). Education, in other words, was mobilized as a marketing device for housing policy, which turned schools into selling points while displacing the very children who once relied on them.
In both cases, the house appears not just as a private dwelling but as the centerpiece of a larger system that decides who belongs, who is excluded, and under what terms communities are remade. To encounter the suburban house, then, is to encounter a whole political landscape that makes its rhythms feel natural while rendering exclusion invisible.
If context sets the routines around the house, symbolism reveals what those routines signify. The single-family suburban home does cultural work: it stands for independence, privacy, respectability, and “stability.” However, these meanings are not neutral; they are shaped by design and policy, and they define what it means to succeed in America. Inside, as Dolores Hayden shows, the conventional dwelling conceals unpaid domestic labor by structuring it as private and feminine. Most homes, she writes, are “organized around the same set of spaces: kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, garage or parking area,” and those spaces “require someone to undertake private cooking, cleaning, child care, and usually private transportation if adults and children are to exist within it” (Hayden, 1980, p. 174). Architecture and zoning merge to naturalize this division: the private home becomes both a workspace and a symbol of self-sufficiency, suggesting that independence is achieved through isolation. Hayden’s counter vision of collective kitchens, communal childcare, and housing linked with transit shows how the house’s design encodes a specific ideology of “good” family life, which is not necessarily the only option. Her critique asks who benefits when care is privatized and dependence is hidden.
That same ideology was expanded nationwide through New Deal housing policy, which tied stability, citizenship, and moral worth to suburban homeownership. Programs such as the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the FHA intentionally built white wealth. HOLC’s redlining maps classified Black neighborhoods as high-risk, while FHA underwriting manuals explicitly warned that property values would fall if African Americans moved into white areas (Rothstein, 2017). FHA officials even approved suburban developments only when physical barriers, such as highways or walls, separated them from Black neighborhoods (Rothstein, 2017). The result was not just unequal access to housing but the creation of an entire moral economy around it. Homeownership became a symbol of discipline and belonging, while exclusion was reinterpreted as a personal failure. The state-engineered foundation for white middle-class wealth was naturalized as individual merit.
By defining success, happiness, and value around the single-family house and racially controlling access to it, America turned structural inequality into common sense. When those policies were later withdrawn, the wealth gap they created persisted. White families passed down property and equity, while Black families were left out of the system entirely (Rothstein, 2017). Modern suburbs inherited this divide. We now understand many neighborhoods as not white-only but simply wealthy, reframing racism as classism; an easier distinction to accept in a capitalist society because it hides behind the myth of mobility. Yet the physical design of suburban space still enforces exclusion. A Black person walking through a white suburb often appears “out of place,” not just because of prejudice but because the built environment leaves no reason for them to be there. Cul-de-sacs, car dependence, and zoning combine to ensure minimal contact across racial differences, so that even the rare interaction becomes charged with suspicion.
The single-family house, therefore, embodies two symbolic systems simultaneously. Gendered, it makes private labor invisible and dependence seem natural. Racialized, it transforms policy-driven exclusion into a moral story about who belongs. The histories that Hayden, Sinclair, and Rothstein expose, of domestic architecture and racialized expertise, reveal how the world is built into the object: ideology becomes infrastructure. The suburban home does not merely reflect American values; it produces them, teaching generations to mistake privilege for virtue and segregation for order.
In the end, the suburban home reveals what a technology truly is: not a neutral tool, but a system that quietly organizes how we live and think. Its walls contain histories of labor, exclusion, and ideology that have shaped generations, turning design into destiny. To see the house clearly is to see how power hides in the ordinary, and how what feels natural is often the most carefully constructed of all.
