Keyword: Eugenics

Eugenics describes the belief that humanity can and should be improved through controlling reproduction. In Race and Science in the 21st Century, Rajagopalan, Nelson, and Fujimura trace how early twentieth-century geneticists fused scientific authority with social hierarchy, turning biology into a moral project. They write that “many prominent early twentieth-century human geneticists in the United States and Europe were also eugenicists, believing that certain debilitating mental and physical diseases ran in particular families,” which justified “voluntary” and, later, coerced sterilization campaigns (Rajagopalan, Nelson, & Fujimura, 2016, p. 355). What makes this term crucial isn’t just its historical violence but its persistence. Eugenics was never just a set of bad policies; it was a worldview that equated moral worth with biological fitness. The authors note that modern genomics still risks opening a “backdoor to eugenics,” as genetic explanations of health and behavior continue to carry social meanings. In that sense, eugenics survives not as an overt ideology but as a pattern of thought: the belief that science can define which lives are worth preventing or promoting.
Eugenics today isn’t so much a movement as an underlying logic that runs through ordinary life. Take embryo selection in IVF. It’s not eugenics in the old sense; there's no forced sterilization or state control, but the same impulse to optimize humanity is still there. Genetic testing lets parents choose embryos less likely to develop certain conditions, which feels compassionate, even responsible. But eugenics once made that same promise of reducing suffering. The keyword helps reveal how care and control can blur into one another. What counts as “harm” or “normal” isn’t decided by nature; it’s shaped by the world we’ve built: our economy, our cities, our idea of success. A person born blind might be equal in principle, but they still live in a world designed against them: cars, screens, and stairs everywhere. In that world, it’s hard to say you wouldn’t make the same choice. The problem isn’t the choice itself; it’s the environment that makes it feel inevitable. Saying “eugenics is bad” doesn’t solve that. The logic persists in our systems and habits of thought. Refusing embryo screening might feel like a moral stand, but accepting it can feel like survival in a society that doesn’t make space for difference. Maybe that’s what the keyword really shows us: eugenics isn’t necessarily a set of bad intentions, but a way of thinking that seeps into everything. We’ve built a world where independence and productivity feel like moral virtues, where moving through life without friction is treated as the goal. In that world, selecting a “healthier” embryo doesn’t feel like coercion. It feels like realism, like adapting to a game you didn’t make but still have to play.
So eugenics now isn’t really about control in the old sense. It’s more subtle than that; it's an ideal that keeps reforming itself inside new systems. When you look at it that way, the moral clarity starts to blur. We’re not building a perfect population on purpose, but we still design tools and environments that push us in that direction. And then we tell ourselves it’s a choice. The keyword helps name that mistake. It’s what makes eugenics such an uncomfortable word to apply here, because it forces us to see how the same logic survives under different names. We talk about progress, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that we’re just reinventing old ideas.
