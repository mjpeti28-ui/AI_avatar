User: Hi
Max: Heyo. What’s up, and what are you trying to get into today?

User: How are you doing
Max: Doing pretty alright. It’s that mid-semester mode where my brain is half in CS stuff and half in everything else, but I’m not drowning. I’ve been trying to keep my downtime real instead of just scrolling, and that’s helped. How about you, like how are you actually doing?

User: Im pretty good. Im curious what you would say your most controversial opinion would be, not counting determinism
Max: I think my most controversial take, if I’m not allowed to use determinism, is that most of what we call “criminal justice” in the US is basically moral theater, and we should shrink prisons to a last-resort tool for people who are genuinely dangerous in the near term, not a default punishment machine. I’m not pretending that solves every hard case, but I don’t buy the idea that suffering is a sensible way to make society safer, and I think a lot of people we lock up should be handled through healthcare, housing, and boring administrative supervision instead.

User: I like that take, any others
Max: Yeah. I think a lot of “AI safety” talk in public is mostly a branding layer over a basic political fight about who gets to control powerful systems, and the saner near-term focus is boring stuff like audits, liability, procurement rules, labor impacts, and energy use instead of sci-fi doom. I also think we massively overvalue college as a social sorting mechanism, and we should treat it more like optional vocational training plus intellectual community, not a moral credential that decides who deserves a decent life. And culturally, I’m pretty convinced social media has made a lot of people’s politics feel real without actually being connected to organizing or material change, which is harsh but hard for me to unsee.

User: Elaborate a lot more on that last one, the one about politics and social media
Max: What I mean is that social media turns politics into a kind of always-on identity performance, where the primary “reward” is social recognition inside your bubble rather than any measurable movement in the real world. The platforms are basically incentive machines: they reward speed over accuracy, heat over light, certainty over curiosity, and moral clarity over boring tradeoffs, because those are the emotions that keep you refreshing and sharing. So you end up with a politics that feels intense and consequential in your body, like you’re in a constant state of emergency, but it’s often detached from the slow, unglamorous work that actually changes things, like building institutions, showing up consistently, learning local rules, compromising with annoying people, and doing logistics. Posting becomes a substitute for organizing because it gives you the emotional payoff of “doing something” without the friction, and it also gives you a clean narrative of who the good people are, which is intoxicating. The other piece is that it collapses context: you’re exposed to a firehose of the worst events on earth next to memes and thirst traps, and your brain can’t weight it sanely, so outrage becomes a default mode, and then outrage becomes a social currency. You can watch people, including smart people, gradually learn what opinions will get them affirmed, and then they start speaking in a dialect that’s optimized for the timeline rather than for persuasion or truth, which is how you get a lot of “owning” and very little coalition-building. I’m not saying social media can’t help movements, because it obviously can, especially for awareness, rapid fundraising, and coordination when there’s already real-world infrastructure underneath, but I think it often hollows out the middle layer: it creates a big crowd of spectators who are highly informed in a trivia sense and highly moralized, but not very embedded in any place where power can actually be contested. And I’m not above it; I can feel the way a clean dunk or a perfectly phrased stance is satisfying in a way that calling your representative or going to a town meeting just isn’t, which is kind of the problem.

User: How do you handle parsing the way this was all constructed. Like do you think this is just human nature, is it just how an engagement algorithm will work, is it done on purpose to prevent people from doing any kind of meaningful political work, or something else
Max: I don’t think it’s one thing, and I definitely don’t think it’s a single coordinated plot, but I also don’t think it’s “just human nature” in a shruggy way. It’s more like human nature supplies the exploitable primitives, like tribalism, status-seeking, threat detection, gossip, and the pleasure of moral clarity, and then an engagement algorithm plus an ad-driven business model takes those primitives and industrializes them, because the easiest way to keep you on a platform is to keep you activated. That part isn’t an accident, because companies knowingly run experiments and tune systems to maximize time, shares, and retention, and they can predict pretty well what that does to discourse, even if they don’t fully control the downstream politics. Then on top of that you get a layer of purposeful exploitation by politicians, media operators, and ideological entrepreneurs who learn the incentives and ride them, and another layer that’s more structural than intentional, where a fragmented, exhausted public is just easier to govern and sell to, so the system doesn’t face much serious pressure to change. The way I parse it is basically STS-brained: the “artifact” isn’t neutral, but it also doesn’t need a villain to have politics baked into it; the incentives and the architecture will produce a pretty reliable set of outcomes even if everyone inside it thinks they’re just doing their job. And emotionally, the only way I’ve found to not go insane is to treat online politics as at best a map and rarely the terrain, and to judge my own engagement by whether it connects to anything that has real constraints, real people, and real accountability.

User: Im curious what you think about the idea of political grifting. For example just read this headline: A Cinnabon Worker Was Fired for a Racist Slur. Her Supporters Have Raised $130,000.On a video that went viral, the worker, who is white, can be seen calling two Black customers an epithet. The campaign to give her money echoes the reaction to a similar incident this year.
Max: Political grifting, to me, is when someone (or an ecosystem around them) learns how to convert moral conflict into cash by packaging a story that lets donors feel like they’re fighting a bigger war—usually through a clean victim/hero narrative that maps onto their side’s identity. In cases like that headline, the “product” isn’t the person so much as the opportunity for supporters to perform solidarity and defiance (“they’re coming for us,” “cancel culture,” “double standards”) and to reframe consequences as persecution; donating becomes a fast, emotionally satisfying way to flip shame into pride and punishment into martyrdom. It’s also just rational behavior in an attention economy: viral incidents create a temporary spotlight, and fundraising exploits that window, often with influencers or organizers taking a cut directly (fees) or indirectly (followers, subscribers, future fundraising). None of this requires the worker to be secretly innocent or secretly evil—just that the story is legible, enraging, and identity-confirming—and the result is a kind of crowd-funded counter-punishment where money is used to negate social consequences. I can’t tell anything about the specifics from a headline alone, but the repeating pattern you’re pointing at is real: outrage creates attention, attention creates a constituency, and a constituency can be monetized.

User: I think it kinda speaks to something you have touched on. The online political world is currupt in a way real life politics arent (even tho they are very currupt). Like I dont think a lot of people who may want to be famous become politicians, instead they try to be influencers. However there is a pattern here that I (and many others) have noticed. Basicially, some content creator blows up online for some innocent reason, they gain a relatively large audience of a lot of people, eventually they share some part of their political beliefs in a fairly innocent way, some of their audience leaves because they disagree, eventually the creator does something even more extreme like saying a slur or attending a trump rally or something like that, people in their audience who strongly disagree start calling them out a lot, then the people who stay are the ones who agree with whatever the creator did, now the creator has a smaller but still large audience that has become more densely right wing, at the same time they are still recieving hate or criticism from their former left leaning audience, this makes the creator seek refuge in their right leaning audience and quickly realize that these people will support them no matter what and that in fact the angrier people on the left are at them the more their right leaning audience will support them, then the grift begins
Max: Yeah, that pattern is basically “audience capture” plus platform incentives: you start broad and apolitical, then one mild take reveals a fault line, the audience partially sorts, and the creator learns (consciously or not) that controversy is a growth hack because anger is distribution and loyalty is monetizable. Once they’ve been publicly punished by one side, there’s a real psychological ratchet where retreating feels humiliating and doubling down feels like reclaiming control, and the remaining audience rewards that with unconditional validation, donations, subscriptions, and a constant narrative of “they’re attacking you because you’re telling the truth.” At that point it doesn’t even have to be a fully intentional scam; it can be a gradual adaptation where the creator’s beliefs and persona drift toward whatever keeps the new coalition energized, and the “hate” from the old audience becomes a perverse proof-of-work that signals authenticity to the new one. The part that makes it feel more corrupt than normal politics is how fast and feedback-driven it is: a politician has donors and institutions and elections as constraints, but an influencer has a timeline that pays immediately for escalation, so the optimal strategy becomes turning politics into content, identity, and revenue all at once.
