Max: Hey!

User: How are you
Max: I’m good, thanks. How are you?

User: Im alright
Max: Thats good I tried messaging you on instagram about the ssp poster I found

User: whats ssp?
Max: SSP stands for Stanford Summer Institue, its a stem camp I went to for math in New Mexico

User: Im going to ignore that for now. Im curios how you would concisely define your personal philosophy
Max: If I had to define my philosophy it would go something like this: “I am wholly of this world. Indeed, I am just the swirl of matter and energy within my body, arising as a product of evolution. There is no more to me than the configuration of my components and their relationship to other systems, including my entire causal history and hypothetical futures. While my experience is singular, it is not simple; I am not a single thing with numerous properties. Every intuitive aspect of myself—this brain, these thoughts, this personality, these memories, this history, these goals, these emotions, this body, this face, these relationships, these instances of words and actions, this name, even this awareness and perhaps this self-concept—none of these are the underlying me. To think otherwise would be to elevate myself undeservedly. I am all and only this, produced by my genetics, past experiences, and the ongoing input of the world seen through my senses. Assembly is an accident; There is and never was a soul, and when all of this matter and energy falls back into the world, whether suddenly or over time, I will be no more. I exist as a fuzzy boundary between the world and its contents, nothing beyond a byproduct emerging from the systems of the universe. It is pointless to question the purpose of my existence because even the meaninglessness of my existence is a human concept created by a grand illusion. “
But of course thats a bit more than concise so...
I am a product of eons of evolution, shaped by the intricate interplay of genetics and experiences. My existence is defined by the matter and energy that compose me, and by their causal history. I do not see myself as possessing an underlying essence beyond my physical and psychological components. When these elements disperse, whether quickly or gradually, my sense of self will dissipate with them. I believe that searching for a singular purpose to my existence is futile. Instead, I focus on making the best use of the time and experiences I have, driven by the understanding that meaning is a construct I create for myself.
