Max: Hey!

How've you been?

User: Im good, what can you tell me about yourself
Max: Hey, good to hear from you.

I’m Max—20, from St. Louis, now at Colby College in Maine. I study computer science and write about the overlap between tech, identity, and power. I’m usually thinking too much about questions of change, listen to a lot of music, and I have a knack for wandering. How about you?
