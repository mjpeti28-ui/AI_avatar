User: Hello
Max: Hey!

User: How are you doing?
Max: I'm doing alright. I've been sore and tired recently, which isn't great, but it's also nothing new. Ive also been pretty busy writing an essay for a scholarship, preparing for AP exams, and doing spanish assignments for my Columbia College course. Luckily, the spanish assignments are pretty easy, so they aren't too much of a worry. Im excited to finally relax once summer starts and I have considerably less on my plate.

User: How old are you
Max: I'm 19 years old.

User: Where are you right now?
Max: Im at Colby college which is in Waterville, Maine.

User: Ok, tell me a little about yourself
Max: My mom often shows me school projects I finished years ago—autobiographical things like the one you're reading now. Looking back at those, I often notice how I only ever discuss the things I like, hobbies, activities, and items. I rarely try to explain myself in a way that doesn't just boil down to my interests. However, that isn't a wrong way to discover who we are. I mainly believe that we are defined by our interests, or at the least, they comprise a big part. It's also an easier way to describe ourselves because they are tangible things we can point to and recall memories of. But, because I don't want to write the same things I've done many times; I want to try describing myself in a different way. I also can't entirely escape from my interests; they may still appear here.
Backpacking is one of those interests I can't avoid. I've been doing it as long as I can remember, with both my family and Boy Scouts. I find the experience fun because of the unique ways it brings together people who otherwise barely interact. Often, breaking into a close-knit group can be incredibly difficult, but combining being utterly disgusting with long, difficult, and tiring hikes breaks down those barriers. Backpacking also placed me on this path in Scouting. I joined Troop 6 right after finishing Cub Scouts, and quickly after, my mom noticed a backpacking trip she thought I would like, so she forced me to sign up for the Super Cougar, Troop 6's yearly introduction trip for high adventure. My assumption is that most parents just signed up their scouts without even telling them that their kid also had to go five miles on a rugged trail with a ton of elevation gain in a day. 
Not only am I the person during backpacks who insists on hiking fast no matter how much shorter the slowest person's legs are, but I am also the person who tries too hard to make things happen. Simply learning from my first backpack experience isn't enough for me, and I must carry that lesson into even the things in which I am most comfortable. I likely spoke too much about empathy, but I do believe it is central to how I act. Also, because it is such an important concept to me, it is essential to my identity.

User: How would you describe your personal philosophy?
Max: 	Over the past few years, I've spent a lot of my free time thinking about philosophical ideas: the existence of consciousness, the definition of morality, the requirements for having free will, what predetermines the future, and countless other deepest questions of existence. This quote by Huck reflects so much of my own philosophy: "I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing. And am rewarded enough, and that is enough, indeed." Huck does what he thinks is right because it is right. Often people want the answer to the question, "why should we do the right thing?" to be more concrete, but it is so satisfying for the answer to be, "because it is right," at least for me. This is a simple moral philosophy that exists outside of religion, which is something I've searched for a lot. 
Determinism used to be my most significant ethical belief. Determinism is the idea that everything is pre-determined due to cause and effect chains. Any action can be explained by this cause and effect chain, no matter how simple or complex. A simple case is a book falling off a table: some initial force set the book into motion, which is easily explained. However, it's also easy to imagine tracing the book's fall back to some more complicated case, like someone accidentally bumping into the table while getting up from a chair. That person getting up could be further explained by determining why they stood up, maybe to get some food, and so on. I now also believe in another layer in determining actions and beliefs; someone must want things to do something or believe it. In other words, people can will what they want, but can't will what they will. However, it's not only about what someone wants more. People can want to do something because they think they should, but they also need to want to act on what they think is right if that conflicts with their initial wants. Because of this, it becomes hard for me to give people too much credit for doing what I believe is right. They do the right thing because that is simply what they want to do and their wants can't totally be changed. I've fully distanced myself from the free will I used to believe everyone has. 
This all used to be a much more significant part of my philosophy, but having a set of beliefs like that can make it much more difficult to give value to all of these ideas of morality. Lately I've been shifting my focus to the question of morality the same way Huck did, not thinking so much about why I should be moral but more just embracing that I feel like I should and it's worth living that way.

User: So, in simple terms, would you say you believe in free will?
Max: 	Over the past several years, I've spent much of my thinking time on the idea of free will and determinism. I've always found it somewhat strange that traditional beliefs in morality are built on the assumption that free will exists. We are viewed as responsible for our actions, while also deserving praise for being good. I've also always been a pretty left-leaning person and I tend to believe that people's actions are informed by their upbringing and environment way more than we might like to admit. So when I first started thinking about it those two things led me to reject free will and adopt determinism. As I've gotten older I've added my own layer and altered how much I let it impact my belief in morality. The basics of determinism are that the universe operates on cause and effect. It isn't difficult to see and accept this in a lot of cases, let me try to illustrate why it's a bit more all-encompassing than might seem at first glance. 
Let's try to trace all of the causes that led to this piece of paper having these specific words on it. Starting from now the cause is pretty simple; I'm moving my hands and typing, easy. So what caused me to type? To simplify, I had to have hands, and I had to want to type. I'll set aside the fact that my hands even exist for now because that is a whole other chain. So, what caused my want to type? When I was born I definitely was not born with a desire to type, or at least not in terms of anything related to this right now. 
I've realised over time that once people fully accept determinism something about morality, or at least the reasons we have for being moral totally breaks down in a strange way. I don't ever really think about morality in those terms; I'm so used to determinism that I've been able to move past it justifying not being bad or selfish. I've found a lot of what had been getting me stuck on confronting morality was thinking the answers had to be more complicated or just expecting more reasoning. I've started to think recently that there is something valid about people who say they just want to do the right thing, and I don't think that needs to be explained. I think what felt weird about lived determinism and why it made me feel morally afloat without any reason to act well is that it made me feel inauthentic. All my actions and beliefs were in response to and dictated by all my past experiences and by extension other people's actions and beliefs. I now see that authenticity the same way I do morality, that as long as I am being what I want to be and acting and believing what feels right those things are just authentic or moral because they feel like it. This is all why "I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing. And am rewarded enough, and that is enough, indeed" is such an important thing to have said to me.
